## 7.2. Getting Started with AWS CloudFormation


### 7.2.1. CloudFormation Basics Summary

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: CloudFormation allows you to model AWS and third-party resources using a structured text format (YAML or JSON) called a CloudFormation template.

2. **Templates and Stacks**: You define resources in a template and create a stack in AWS. CloudFormation manages and updates these resources based on the template.

3. **Change Management**: CloudFormation tracks changes and applies them consistently. It can create Change Sets for approval before applying changes.

4. **Problem Solved**: It helps manage resources that depend on each other, allowing you to group them into stacks and handle creation, updates, and deletions efficiently.

5. **Benefits**:
     - **Automate Best Practices**: Integrates with CI/CD pipelines and tools like GitHub Actions and AWS CodePipeline.
     - **Scale Worldwide**: Share templates across accounts and regions. Use StackSets for multi-account management.
     - **AWS Integration**: Works with AWS IAM, AWS Config, AWS Service Catalog, and other AWS services for automation and governance.
     - **Manage Third-Party Resources**: Includes third-party resources in your CloudFormation management and build custom resource providers.
     - **Community Extensions**: Utilize open-source projects and the CloudFormation registry to extend functionality and enforce best practices.

6. **Architecting Cloud Solutions**: Manage all infrastructure as code, use code repositories and CI/CD pipelines for creating and updating resources.

7. **Usage Scenarios**:
     - **Single Developers**: Quickly create and destroy stacks for testing and learning, then scale as needed.
     - **Enterprises**: Use CloudFormation for managing AWS resources through CI/CD pipelines and possibly for resources outside AWS.
     - **Disaster Recovery**: Recreate infrastructure in different regions or accounts for business continuity.

8. **Best Practices**:
     - **Stack Creation**: Use integration pipelines rather than manual stack creation.
     - **Resource Lifecycle**: Be cautious of resource changes and replacements.
     - **Avoid Manual Updates**: Do not modify stack resources outside of CloudFormation.

9. **Cost**: CloudFormation itself is free. Charges apply only for the resources created and API calls made on your behalf. Third-party resources may incur additional charges.

## 7.4. AWS Lambda Foundations


### 7.4.1 Introduction

  - **Serverless Computing**: Allows developers to focus on writing code without managing underlying infrastructure, as AWS handles all operational tasks like scaling, monitoring, and maintaining servers.

  - **Traditional vs Serverless**: Traditional environments require configuration, OS updates, and application platform installation, while serverless abstracts these tasks, reducing overhead and accelerating innovation.

  - **AWS Serverless Platform**: Includes fully managed services like AWS Lambda, which are integrated with tools such as AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) for simplifying serverless application deployment.

  - **AWS Lambda**: A compute service that runs code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda automatically scales, handles resource management, and integrates with event-driven architectures.

  - **Lambda Benefits**:
    - **No Server Management**: Run code without maintaining servers.
    - **Event-Driven Execution**: Initiates functions in response to events.
    - **Automatic Scaling**: Scales to handle incoming events.
    - **Monitoring & Logging**: Built-in monitoring via Amazon CloudWatch.

  - **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses events to trigger actions across decoupled services, enabling asynchronous communication and processing within serverless applications.

  - **Lambda Functions**: Stateless pieces of code that execute in response to events, capable of scaling rapidly to handle varying loads, and can be integrated with services like S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, and SNS.



### 7.4.2. How AWS Lambda Works

  - **Event-driven architecture**: AWS Lambda operates based on events that trigger functions to execute the code within.
  - **Invocation models**:
    - **Synchronous Invocation**:
    - Lambda runs the function and waits for a response.
    - No built-in retries; retry logic must be managed in the application code.
    - Used by services like Amazon API Gateway, Amazon CloudFront, and others.
    - **Asynchronous Invocation**:
    - Events are queued, and the function executes without the client waiting for a response.
    - Supports destinations to send records of invocations to other services (e.g., EventBridge, SQS).
    - Used by services like Amazon SNS, Amazon S3, and Amazon EventBridge.
    - **Polling Invocation**:
    - Lambda polls services like Amazon Kinesis, SQS, or DynamoDB Streams and invokes functions based on the events.
    - AWS manages the polling and invocation process.
  
  - **Error handling**:
    - **Synchronous**: No retries; you need to handle errors in your code.
    - **Asynchronous**: Built-in retries twice.
    - **Polling**: Retry behavior varies depending on the event source.

  - **Lambda execution environment**:
    - **Secure and isolated**: Manages resources for function execution, including lifecycle support for the runtime and extensions.
    - **Lifecycle phases**:
      - **Init phase**: Sets up the execution environment, initializes runtime, and prepares extensions.
      - **Invoke phase**: Handles the actual invocation of the function.
      - **Shutdown phase**: Shuts down the environment when not in use.
  
  - **Cold and warm starts**:
    - **Cold start**: Occurs when a new execution environment is required, leading to increased latency.
    - **Warm start**: Reuses the existing environment, reducing startup latency.
  
  - **Performance optimization**:
  - Minimize cold start times by using provisioned concurrency to prepare execution environments in advance.
  - Write functions to take advantage of warm starts by:
    - Storing dependencies locally.
    - Limiting re-initialization of variables.
    - Reusing existing connections.
    - Using `/tmp` space as a transient cache.
    - Ensuring background processes are completed.



### 7.4.3. AWS Lambda Function Permissions

  - **Lambda Function Permissions** involve two key aspects:
    - **Permission to Invoke**: Controlled via an IAM resource-based policy.
    - **Permission to Act**: Defined by the Lambda function's IAM execution role.

  - **Execution Role**:
  - Assigned to Lambda functions to grant permissions to interact with other AWS services.
  - The role's policy defines allowed actions, e.g., writing to DynamoDB.
  - Must include a trust policy that allows Lambda to "AssumeRole."
  - Can use managed roles or create custom roles with the principle of least privilege.

  - **IAM Access Analyzer**:
  - Helps identify necessary permissions by analyzing AWS CloudTrail logs.
  - Generates policy templates based on permissions used during the analysis period.

  - **Resource-based Policy**:
  - Grants permissions to invoke the Lambda function to specific AWS principals (users, roles, services, or accounts).
  - Facilitates cross-account access by allowing other accounts to invoke the function.
  - Resource policies are easier to manage but have size limits for complex cross-account scenarios.

  - **Policy Comparison**:
    - **Resource-based Policies**: Associated with push event sources like API Gateway; created when triggers are added.
    - **Execution Roles**: Selected/created during function creation, controlling actions within the resource.

  - **Ease of Policy Management**:
  - Use AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to manage policies efficiently.
  - AWS SAM scopes Lambda permissions to resources used by the application.

  - **VPC Access**:
  - Lambda functions can access VPC resources with additional VPC-specific configurations (subnet and security group IDs).
  - Requires an execution role with permissions to manage elastic network interfaces.
  - AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole policy is provided for this purpose.

  - **AWS PrivateLink**:
  - Allows private connections between VPC and Lambda using interface VPC endpoints.
  - Enables secure, private access to Lambda APIs without needing public IPs or external connections.


### 7.4.4. Authoring AWS Lambda Functions


  - **Lambda Programming Model**: You can use your own code with AWS Lambda, adapting it to a serverless architecture without significant rewrites. Lambda supports various programming languages like Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, and PowerShell.

  - **IDE Integration**: Lambda is compatible with popular IDEs such as VSCode, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and PyCharm. Custom runtimes are also supported, allowing flexibility in development environments.

  - **Handler Method**: The Lambda function handler is the method that processes events. It receives two objects: the event object (which contains data and metadata) and the context object (which provides runtime information).

  - **Event Object**: The event object structure varies depending on the event source (e.g., API Gateway, S3). It contains all the necessary data for your function's logic.

  - **Design Best Practices**: 
    - **Separation of Concerns**: Separate business logic from the handler method to enhance portability and facilitate unit testing.
    - **Modularity**: Write modular functions to reduce deployment package size and simplify maintenance.
    - **Statelessness**: Treat Lambda functions as stateless. Use external services like DynamoDB, ElastiCache, or S3 to manage state data.

  - **Minimize Dependencies**: Only include necessary dependencies in your deployment package to reduce startup time. For example, avoid including entire AWS SDKs if not required.

  - **Logging**: Implement structured logging in your Lambda functions, which is crucial for monitoring and debugging via Amazon CloudWatch.

  - **Return Coding**: Ensure your function properly returns results or uses context methods (in languages like Node.js) to terminate the function and return values to the caller.

  - **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to manage operational parameters and sensitive data, with encryption provided by AWS Lambdaâ€™s key management service.

  - **Secrets Management**: Integrate AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store to securely manage and retrieve secrets and configuration data in your Lambda functions.

  - **Avoid Recursive Code**: Prevent Lambda functions from calling themselves to avoid uncontrolled scaling and potential concurrency issues.

  - **CloudWatch Metrics**: Use the CloudWatch embedded metric format (EMF) to automatically extract and visualize metrics from structured log events in CloudWatch.

  - **Reuse Execution Context**: Optimize performance by reusing execution context during warm starts, including local storage of dependencies, minimizing re-initialization, and using temporary storage.

  - **Lambda Console Editor**: For simple functions, use the Lambda console editor for easy development and deployment. Itâ€™s suitable for small, standalone applications or initial experimentation.

  - **Deployment Packages**: Advance from the console by using deployment packages (either .zip files or container images) to deploy more complex Lambda functions.

  - **Automation with AWS SAM**: Utilize AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to automate the deployment of serverless applications. SAM CLI can assist in testing, debugging, and validating Lambda functions locally before deploying them to the cloud.


### 7.4.5. Configuring Your Lambda Functions

  - **Memory Configuration:**
  - AWS Lambda allows up to 10 GB of memory allocation per function.
  - CPU and other resources are allocated linearly in proportion to the configured memory.
  - Increasing memory can reduce execution time, potentially lowering overall costs despite higher memory usage.
  - Use AWS Lambda Power Tuning tool to optimize memory and CPU settings for cost, speed, or a balanced approach.

  - **Timeout Configuration:**
  - The maximum timeout for a Lambda function is 900 seconds (15 minutes).
  - Set the timeout value based on real-world testing to avoid unnecessary costs from lengthy executions.
  - Analyzing function duration helps in identifying issues that cause longer-than-expected execution times.
  - Lambda charges based on runtime in 1-ms increments; reducing timeout can help minimize billing.

  - **Concurrency Configuration:**
  - Concurrency determines the number of function invocations that can run simultaneously.
    - **Types of Concurrency:**
      - **Unreserved Concurrency:** Default concurrency available for functions without custom limits.
      - **Reserved Concurrency:** Guarantees a fixed number of concurrent executions for a specific function.
      - **Provisioned Concurrency:** Pre-initializes environments for functions to respond with low latency, ideal for high-performance needs.
  - Concurrency limits can help manage costs, control processing times, and align with downstream resources that scale slower than Lambda.

  - **Scaling and Bursting:**
  - Lambda can handle sudden increases in function invocations with burst concurrency.
  - Burst concurrency varies by region (e.g., 3000 in US West, 1000 in Asia Pacific).
  - Functions scale beyond burst limits by an additional 500 instances per minute until a concurrency limit is reached.

  - **Billing Considerations:**
  - Charges are based on the number of requests and function duration, measured in GB-seconds.
  - The AWS Lambda Free Tier includes 1 million free requests and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.
  - Itâ€™s crucial to optimize memory and timeout settings to balance performance and cost effectively.

  - **Testing and Monitoring:**
  - Always test Lambda functions under real-world conditions to determine optimal memory, timeout, and concurrency settings.
  - Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor metrics like ConcurrentExecutions and UnreservedConcurrentExecutions for performance insights.
  - Conduct load testing to simulate peak usage, test backend capacity, and verify error handling under high concurrency conditions.

  - **Cost Optimization:**
  - Higher memory configurations can reduce execution time, potentially lowering overall cost.
  - AWS Lambda Power Tuning helps visualize and adjust memory and CPU configurations for cost-effectiveness.

  - **Provisioned Concurrency Costs:**
  - You pay for the amount of provisioned concurrency configured and the time it's active.
  - Scale provisioned concurrency up during traffic peaks and down afterward to avoid unnecessary costs.



### 7.4.6. Deploying and Testing Serverless Applications

  - **Server-Based vs. Serverless Deployment**: Server-based deployments are like moving into a prebuilt house, where the infrastructure is predefined, while serverless deployments are akin to designing and building a house from scratch using detailed specifications.

  - **AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)**: AWS SAM simplifies serverless development by transforming simplified instructions into detailed CloudFormation templates, which act as blueprints for deploying serverless applications.

  - **Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation**: The entire infrastructure for a Lambda function is specified in a CloudFormation template, making it possible to deploy identical stacks across multiple AWS accounts.

  - **Server-Based Developer Workflow**: Involves coding, local testing, and passing the code to DevOps for deployment, similar to moving into a pre-existing house where environments are pre-configured.

  - **Serverless Developer Workflow**: Developers package code and dependencies with a CloudFormation template, which is then deployed and tested in the cloud. Localized testing isn't an option due to the cloud-based environment.

  - **Environmental Parity**: AWS SAM ensures that identical stacks are deployed across multiple accounts, maintaining consistency in serverless applications.

  - **Simplified Experimentation**: AWS SAM allows for quick experimentation by creating and deploying stacks without the overhead of managing physical instances.

  - **Creating and Deploying with AWS SAM and Cloud9**: The demo covers creating, editing, and deploying a Lambda function using AWS SAM and Cloud9, including triggering functions with S3 events and writing outputs to DynamoDB.

  - **CloudFormation as a Blueprint**: Just like a house blueprint, the CloudFormation template specifies every detail required to build and deploy a serverless environment.

  - **Streamlined Deployment with AWS SAM**: AWS SAM reduces the complexity of managing CloudFormation templates by offering simplified commands for common serverless resources.

  - **AWS SAM Advantages**: Provides environmental parity, simplifies testing and deployment, and allows rapid experimentation in serverless environments.

  - **Hands-On Demonstration**: The lesson includes a practical demonstration of using AWS SAM and Cloud9 to deploy a Lambda function triggered by S3 events, with outputs written to DynamoDB.

  - **Practical Challenges with Serverless**: Unlike server-based environments, serverless deployment lacks the option for localized testing, necessitating cloud-based testing and deployment.

  - **AWS SAM as a CloudFormation Simplifier**: AWS SAM converts simplified instructions into detailed CloudFormation templates, making it easier to build and deploy serverless applications.

  - **Deployment Consistency**: AWS SAM ensures that the same serverless environment is consistently deployed across multiple AWS accounts, aiding in maintaining uniformity.

  - **CloudFormation and SAM Integration**: AWS SAM integrates closely with CloudFormation, using it as a foundation while simplifying its use for developers.



### 7.4.7. Monitoring and Troubleshooting

# 12. Day 12 - Securing and Protecting Your Data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) - Protecting Your Instance with Security Groups

## 12.1 Securing and Protecting Your Data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)


### 12.1.1 AWS S3 Security Concepts

In AWS, security is a shared responsibility between the customer and AWS. This model divides the security responsibilities into two categories: **Security "of" the cloud** (managed by AWS) and **Security "in" the cloud** (managed by the customer). The extent of the customer's responsibilities depends on the services they use.

Security Responsibilities
| Responsibility | Managed By | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Infrastructure** | AWS | AWS manages the physical infrastructure, including hardware, software, networking, and facilities. |
| **Virtualization Layer & Host OS** | AWS | AWS secures and operates the virtualization layer and the host operating system. |
| **Guest OS & Application Software** | Customer | The customer is responsible for managing and securing the guest OS, application software, updates, and patches. |
| **Data Management** | Customer | The customer must manage and secure their data, including encryption and access controls. |

AWS S3 Security Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Block Public Access** | Enforces a no-public-access policy on S3 resources, overriding other permissions. Centralized controls are set by administrators to limit public access. Enabled by default. |
| **IAM Policies** | S3 uses both resource-based and user-based IAM policies to manage access to buckets and objects. Customers can use bucket policies to grant access to specific users or accounts. |
| **Access Points** | Simplifies data access management at scale. Access points are network endpoints attached to buckets, each with distinct permissions and network controls for S3 object operations. |
| **Presigned URLs** | Allows temporary, time-limited access to objects via URLs. Useful for sharing objects or enabling uploads without AWS credentials. |
| **Encryption** | Protects data both in-transit and at-rest, ensuring it cannot be accessed by unauthorized users. |
| **VPC Endpoints** | Enables private connectivity to S3 within a VPC, routing traffic within the Amazon network, eliminating the need for internet gateways or VPN connections. |

Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively managing and securing your AWS environment, particularly with services like Amazon S3, where customer-managed security tasks include data classification, encryption, and IAM policy management.

### 12.1.2 Protecting Data from Unintended Public Access



In the AWS lesson on "Protecting Data from Unintended Public Access," the focus is on ensuring that data stored in Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is secure and not inadvertently exposed to the public. The lesson covers the importance of compliance with regulations, such as HIPAA, and details how to use Amazon S3's "Block Public Access" feature to protect data.



- **Compliance Requirements**: Compliance and HIPAA regulations require that no data stored in S3 should be publicly accessible.

- **Amazon S3 Block Public Access**: This feature allows you to block public access to all objects either at the bucket or account level, protecting against unauthorized or unintentional access.

- **Private vs. Public Access**:
  - **Private Access**: Only principals within your AWS account can access the objects unless explicitly shared.
  - **Public Access**: A bucket or object is public if permissions are granted to the `AuthenticatedUsers` or `AllUsers` groups.

- **Block Public Access Default Settings**:
  - **Default Setting**: Block Public Access is enabled by default for new buckets, access points, and objects.
  - **Overriding Permissions**: Even if a user modifies permissions to allow public access, the Block Public Access setting will override it.

- **Why Avoid Public Access**: Exposing buckets or objects to the public can lead to unauthorized access, which most businesses want to avoid to protect their intellectual property and sensitive data.

- **Enabling Public Access**:
  - **Selective Access**: You can enable public access to specific buckets or objects via ACLs, access point policies, and bucket policies.
  - **Limitations**: Block Public Access cannot be enabled on a per-object basis; it applies only to access points, buckets, and AWS accounts.

- **Block Public Access Settings**:
  - **Block Public Access through New ACLs**: Prevents the creation of new ACLs that grant public access.
  - **Block Public Access through Any ACLs**: Ignores any existing ACLs that grant public permissions.
  - **Block Public Access through New Public Bucket Policies**: Prevents the creation of new bucket policies that grant public access.
  - **Block Public and Cross-Account Access through Any Public Bucket Policies**: Ignores existing public bucket policies and restricts access to authorized users within the account.

Example Commands and Operations

| **Command/Action**                   | **Description**                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S3 Block Public Access**           | Blocks public access at the bucket or account level to protect data from unauthorized access.               |
| **Private Access**                   | Limits access to objects to only those within your AWS account.                                              |
| **Public Access**                    | Grants access to objects to either authenticated AWS users (`AuthenticatedUsers`) or all users (`AllUsers`). |
| **Block Public Access Settings**     | Includes settings to block new ACLs, ignore existing public ACLs, prevent new public bucket policies, and block cross-account access. |
| **Enable Public Access for Bucket**  | Can be done through ACLs, bucket policies, or access point policies, but with Block Public Access settings, public access is restricted. |

This summary provides a detailed overview of how AWS S3's "Block Public Access" feature helps in securing data and meeting compliance requirements.

### 12.1.3 AWS Access Policies



Access policies in AWS define who can access which resources and what actions they can perform. These policies are crucial in managing permissions and ensuring security within an AWS environment.

Key Concepts and Components

1. **Types of Access Policies:**
   - **Resource-Based Policies**: Attached to AWS resources like S3 buckets and objects.
   - **Identity-Based Policies**: Attached to IAM identities (users, groups, roles) to define permissions.

2. **Policy Structure:**
   Policies are written in JSON and consist of the following elements:
   - **Effect**: Specifies if the action is allowed or denied (`Allow` or `Deny`).
   - **Action**: Defines the action (e.g., `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`).
   - **Principal**: Identifies who (which user, role, or account) is allowed or denied.
   - **Resource**: Specifies the resource ARN (e.g., an S3 bucket or object).
   - **Condition** (Optional): Defines conditions under which the policy applies.

3. **IAM Policies vs. Bucket Policies:**
   - **IAM Policies**:
     - Centralized management of permissions.
     - Used for controlling access to multiple AWS services.
     - Useful when managing numerous S3 buckets with different permissions.
   - **Bucket Policies**:
     - Specific to S3 and attached directly to the bucket.
     - Suitable for cross-account access or when IAM policies reach size limits.

4. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
   - ACLs manage access at the bucket or object level.
   - Define which AWS accounts or groups can access a resource.
   - Less flexible than JSON-based policies but useful for specific use cases.

Policy Size Limits

| Entity  | Maximum Policy Size |
|---------|---------------------|
| User    | 2,048 characters     |
| Role    | 10,240 characters    |
| Group   | 5,120 characters     |
| Bucket  | 20 KB               |

Example Use Cases

1. **IAM Policies**: 
   - Use when you need centralized permission management across various services.
   - Ideal for managing access to multiple S3 buckets with different access needs.
   
2. **Bucket Policies**:
   - Use for granting cross-account access.
   - Useful when you want to manage access control within the S3 environment itself.



In a practical scenario,  to customize IAM policies for users Jane and Mateo based on their specific access requirements. The process involved:
- Creating an IAM group to manage permissions for multiple users.
- Adding inline policies to users for specific access to S3 buckets and objects.

This hands-on practice reinforces the importance of carefully crafting policies to control access effectively, ensuring users only have permissions they need.

### 12.1.4 AWS Access Policy Evaluation Logic 


When a request is made by an IAM entity (user or role) to access a resource within the same AWS account, AWS evaluates the permissions granted by both identity-based and resource-based policies. Here's a detailed breakdown of how this evaluation process works:

Operation Logic

1. **Evaluation of Access Policies**:
    - AWS first verifies that the requester has necessary permissions.
    - All applicable policies are converted into a key-value file called the *request context*.
    - AWS then evaluates this set of policies to decide whether to authorize the request.

2. **Evaluation Steps**:
    - **Step 1: User Context**  
      Evaluates the userâ€™s policy and any resource policies if the parent account owns the resource.
      
    - **Step 2: Bucket Context**  
      Determines bucket access by checking whether the bucket owner has denied access to the object.
      
    - **Step 3: Object Context**  
      Evaluates policies owned by the object owner.

    If any of these steps result in an explicit deny, the request is denied.

Example of Policy Usage

- **Jane's Scenario**:  
  Jane was given permissions to view a sensitive folder, `/private`, which needed to be restricted. The solution involved adding explicit deny statements to the group's managed policy, ensuring that neither Jane nor any other group member could access the folder.

  **Modified Group Policy with Explicit Deny**:
  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Sid": "ViewS3bucketsInConsole",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
          },
          {
              "Sid": "ExplictDenyAccessToPrivateFolderToEveryoneInTheGroup",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:*"
              ],
              "Effect": "Deny",
              "Resource": [
                  "arn:aws:s3:::healthcare-sales1/private/*"
              ]
          },
          {
              "Sid": "DenyListBucketOnPrivateFolder",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:ListBucket"
              ],
              "Effect": "Deny",
              "Resource": [
                  "arn:aws:s3:::healthcare-sales1"
              ],
              "Condition": {
                  "StringLike": {
                      "s3:prefix": [
                          "private/"
                      ]
                  }
              }
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

S3 Object Ownership

- **Object Ownership Modes**:
  - **Object Writer**: The account uploading the object owns it.
  - **Bucket Owner Preferred**: The bucket owner becomes the object owner if the object is uploaded with the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL.

- **Enforcing Object Ownership**:
  - A bucket policy can be used to enforce that all PUT operations include the `bucket-owner-full-control` ACL, ensuring uniform object ownership across the bucket.



| **Step**        | **Context**                  | **Action**                                                                                     |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Step 1**      | User Context                 | Evaluates user and resource policies if the parent owns the resource.                          |
| **Step 2**      | Bucket Context               | Checks bucket owner permissions and evaluates explicit denies for object access.              |
| **Step 3**      | Object Context               | Evaluates object owner policies to determine access rights.                                    |
| **Enforcement** | S3 Object Ownership          | Bucket policy enforces ownership with `bucket-owner-full-control` ACL requirement.             |

### 12.1.5 Managing Access at Scale Using Access Points


The principle of least privilege is crucial for securely managing access in AWS, especially with Amazon S3. This principle involves granting only the minimal necessary permissions required to complete a task, thereby minimizing security vulnerabilities. In S3, itâ€™s essential to create policies that allow users, roles, and applications to perform only specific tasks on S3 resources.

**Access Points Overview**

- **Access Points** are network endpoints that attach to S3 buckets, enforcing distinct permissions and network controls. They simplify access management for large datasets and reduce the complexity of bucket policies.
- **Access Point Names** must be unique within an AWS account and region, adhere to DNS naming restrictions, and follow specific format rules.
  
**Limitations of Access Points**

- Each access point is linked to only one bucket, and thereâ€™s a maximum of 1,000 access points per AWS account per region.
- Access points are restricted to operations on objects; they cannot modify or delete buckets and may not be compatible with all AWS services.
  
**Monitoring and Permissions**

- Logging for access points is available in CloudTrail, enabling auditing of S3 requests. Permissions for access points can be customized to restrict public access or limit access by object prefixes and tags.

**Advantages of Access Points**

- Access points provide a simpler way to manage shared datasets in a bucket, allowing different applications or departments to have tailored access controls.
- Access points help enforce data residency within a VPC, ensuring that data doesnâ€™t leave the Amazon network.

**Access Control Mechanisms**

- Permissions in an access point policy require corresponding permissions in the underlying bucket policy. AWS recommends delegating bucket access control to access points.
- You can further refine permissions using conditions in policies.

**Network Origin for Access Points**

- Access points can be configured to accept requests only from a specific VPC or from the internet. The network origin determines how and where the access point can be accessed.

**Block Public Access Settings**

- Each access point supports independent Block Public Access settings, which are enabled by default. These settings should be kept enabled unless thereâ€™s a specific requirement for public access.

**ARN Formats for Access Points and Objects**

| **Component**              | **ARN Format Example**                                             | **Details**                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Access Point ARN**        | `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:1234567890:accesspoint/healthcare`          | - Partition: `arn:aws:s3` <br> - Region: `us-west-2` <br> - Account-id: `1234567890` <br> - Accesspoint/resource: `healthcare` |
| **Object ARN**              | `arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:123456789012:accesspoint/aptest/object/monthlyreport` | - Partition: `arn:aws:s3` <br> - Region: `us-east-1` <br> - Account-id: `123456789012` <br> - Accesspoint/access-point-name: `aptest` <br> - Object/resource: `object/monthlyreport` |

**Conclusion**

Using S3 access points allows for more granular and scalable access control, enhancing security and management efficiency for large datasets across different applications and departments.

### 12.1.1 Sharing Objects Using Presigned URLs in AWS



In AWS, all S3 buckets and objects are private by default. To share objects with users outside of AWS without making the bucket or objects public, you can generate a **presigned URL**. This URL grants temporary access to specific objects in a bucket for a limited time.

Key Points:

- **Purpose of Presigned URLs**:
  - Allow temporary access to an object without requiring AWS credentials.
  - Can be used for both downloading and uploading objects.

- **Necessary Information for Creating a Presigned URL**:
  - **Bucket name**
  - **Object key**
  - **HTTP method** (e.g., `PUT` for uploading)
  - **Expiration date and time**

- **Use Cases**:
  - Embedding live links in HTML (valid up to 7 days).
  - Sharing objects via command-line tools like `curl`.
  - Allowing users to upload objects to a bucket.

Permissions:
- The user creating the presigned URL must have the necessary permissions to perform the intended operation (e.g., read or write) on the object.

Credentials:
- **IAM instance profile**: Valid for up to 6 hours.
- **AWS Security Token Service (STS)**: Valid for up to 36 hours with permanent credentials.
- **IAM user**: Valid for up to 7 days using AWS Signature Version 4.

- **Note**: If a presigned URL is created with a temporary token, it will expire when the token expires, even if a later expiration time is specified for the URL.

Tools for Generating Presigned URLs:
- **AWS CLI**
- **REST API**
- **AWS SDKs**: Available in multiple languages including Java, .NET, Ruby, PHP, Node.js, Python, and Go.

Example Workflow:

1. **Access AWS Management Console**:
   - Log in with an administrator account.
   - Navigate to S3 and select the desired bucket.

2. **Generate a Presigned URL using AWS CLI**:
   - List your buckets using `aws s3 ls`.
   - Generate the presigned URL using the command:
     ```bash
     aws s3 presign s3://bucket-name/object-key --region us-east-1 --expires-in 240
     ```
   - The generated URL will expire in 4 minutes (240 seconds).

3. **Use the URL**:
   - Copy and paste the generated presigned URL into a browser to access the object.

| **Section**         | **Details** |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Default Privacy** | Objects and buckets are private by default. |
| **Access Control**  | Share objects with presigned URLs. |
| **Expiration**      | URLs expire after the specified time. |
| **Tools**           | AWS CLI, SDKs, REST API |
| **Permissions**     | User must have necessary object permissions. |
| **Credentials**     | IAM user, IAM instance profile, STS |

This approach allows secure and temporary access to S3 objects, ensuring privacy while facilitating controlled sharing.


### 12.1.1 Data protection in Amazon S3


**Data in Transit**
- **Methods**: 
  - **HTTPS**: Encrypted using TLS to protect data during transfer.
  - **Client-side encryption**: Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted upon receiving.

- **Enforcing HTTPS**:
  - Use the `aws:SecureTransport` condition in S3 bucket policies to enforce HTTPS.
  
- **AWS Config Rules**:
  - Use the `s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only` AWS Config rule to ensure S3 buckets enforce encrypted requests.

**Data at Rest**
- **Server-Side Encryption**:
  - **SSE-S3**: Encrypts each object with a unique key managed by Amazon S3 using AES-256.
  - **SSE-KMS**: Uses Customer Master Keys (CMKs) managed in AWS KMS. Offers centralized key management and auditing.
  - **SSE-C**: Allows users to manage their own keys while Amazon S3 handles encryption/decryption.
  - **S3 Bucket Keys**: Reduce AWS KMS request costs by generating bucket-level keys that reduce encryption request traffic.

- **Default Encryption**:
  - Applies encryption automatically to new objects in a bucket.
  - Can be set to use either SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS.
  - Does not apply retroactively to existing objectsâ€”requires S3 Batch Operations for that.

**Comparison of Encryption Methods**

| **Encryption Method** | **Key Management** | **Key Rotation** | **Cost** | **Use Cases** |
|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------|----------|---------------|
| **SSE-S3**            | Managed by S3      | Automatic         | No additional cost | Basic encryption needs |
| **SSE-KMS**           | Managed by AWS KMS | User-managed      | Additional charges apply | Centralized key management, audit controls |
| **SSE-C**             | User-managed       | User-managed      | No additional cost | Full control over encryption keys |
| **S3 Bucket Keys**    | Managed by S3 (with AWS KMS integration) | Managed by AWS KMS | Cost-saving for large datasets | High-volume workloads requiring encryption |

**Additional Considerations**
- **Default Encryption**: Ensures all new objects are encrypted without additional setup after configuration.
- **Monitoring and Auditing**: AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch can be used to track encryption-related activities.




### 12.1.1 Simplify Access With Amazon VPC Endpoints

**Summary:**

- **VPC Endpoint Overview:**  
  A VPC endpoint allows secure connectivity between a VPC and AWS services (like S3) without requiring an internet gateway or NAT device. Traffic stays within the Amazon network, ensuring private communication. VPC endpoints use AWS PrivateLink for private access using private IP addresses.

- **Types of VPC Endpoints:**  
  There are two types of VPC endpoints:
  - **Gateway Endpoints:**  
    - Supported Services: Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.
    - Functionality: Specified in the route table to direct traffic to the gateway endpoint, keeping data within the AWS network, and enhancing security for private subnets.
    - Benefits: 
      - Reduces data transfer costs.
      - Improves security using IAM, endpoint, and S3 bucket policies.
      - Ensures compliance by keeping data within the Amazon network.
  - **Interface Endpoints:**  
    - Description: An elastic network interface with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic destined for supported AWS services.
    - Functionality: Extends on-premises networks to the VPC, reducing complexity and the need for proxy servers.
    - Benefits:
      - Lowers data transfer costs.
      - Enhances security with endpoint policies and security groups.
      - Simplifies network and firewall configurations for S3 access.

- **Feature Comparison:**

  | **Feature**            | **Gateway Endpoints**                              | **Interface Endpoints**                                    |
  |------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | **Security**           | Endpoint policies                                 | Endpoint policies and security groups                     |
  | **Network Connectivity** | Connects via Amazon network to S3/DynamoDB        | Connects via AWS PrivateLink to AWS services               |
  | **Access Outside VPC** | Not accessible outside VPC                        | Accessible from on-premises and across regions            |
  | **IP Connectivity**    | Uses public IPs of S3, modifies route table       | Uses private IPs, can use public or endpoint-specific DNS names |
  | **Cost**               | No additional charge                              | Charges a fee                                             |

- **How Gateway Endpoints Work:**  
  Gateway endpoints connect a VPC with services like Amazon S3 or DynamoDB by adding a route in the route table. The route directs requests to the appropriate service through the endpoint, ensuring secure access for subnets associated with the modified route table.

- **Access Control with Endpoint Policies:**  
  An endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy attached to a VPC endpoint that controls access. Important aspects include:
  - Explicitly denying access to actions not listed in the policy.
  - Using a default policy if none is attached.
  - Endpoint policies do not override IAM user policies or service-specific policies but add an additional layer of control.

- **Securing Endpoints:**  
  Security for both gateway and interface endpoints can be managed through resource policies on the endpoint itself and on the resource being accessed. Using endpoint policies, AWS applies the most restrictive set of permissions, ensuring secure data transit within the VPC.

Amazon Macie can integrate with Amazon GuardDuty to enhance security monitoring. GuardDuty uses threat intelligence and machine learning to identify unauthorized or malicious activity in AWS environments. For comprehensive monitoring, AWS recommends using Amazon S3 protection in GuardDuty to track object-level events in S3 buckets.




## 12.2 Protecting Your Instance with Security Groups

AWS Security Groups are crucial for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to your EC2 instances. They function as virtual firewalls, allowing you to define rules that specify which traffic is permitted or denied.

**Key Points:**

- **Stateful Rules**: Security Groups are stateful, meaning if you allow inbound traffic from an IP, the response traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of outbound rules.

- **Inbound Rules**: Specify which incoming traffic is permitted. You can configure rules based on IP protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP), port range, and source IP address or CIDR block.

- **Outbound Rules**: Define what outgoing traffic is allowed from your instance. Similar to inbound rules, they can be set by protocol, port range, and destination IP address or CIDR block.

- **Default Security Group**: Every VPC comes with a default Security Group that allows all inbound traffic from instances assigned to the same Security Group and allows all outbound traffic.

- **Multiple Security Groups**: You can associate multiple Security Groups with an instance. The effective rules for that instance are the combination of all associated Security Groups' rules.

- **Rules Evaluation**: Security Group rules are evaluated based on the most permissive rule. For instance, if multiple Security Groups allow traffic from the same IP, it will be permitted.

- **Changes in Real-Time**: Changes to Security Group rules are applied in real-time. There is no need to restart your instance for changes to take effect.

**Examples of Use Cases:**

- **Allow HTTP and HTTPS Traffic**: Allow inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS) for web servers.
- **Restrict SSH Access**: Allow inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH) only from specific IP addresses or ranges for secure administrative access.

**Markdown Table for Specific Rules**

| Rule Type      | Protocol | Port Range | Source/Destination        | Description                                      |
|----------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Inbound         | TCP      | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0                 | Allow HTTP traffic from all IPs                 |
| Inbound         | TCP      | 443        | 0.0.0.0/0                 | Allow HTTPS traffic from all IPs                |
| Inbound         | TCP      | 22         | 192.168.1.0/24            | Allow SSH traffic only from internal network    |
| Outbound        | All      | All        | 0.0.0.0/0                 | Allow all outbound traffic                      |
| Outbound        | TCP      | 3306       | 10.0.0.0/16               | Allow MySQL traffic to specific internal range  |

**Best Practices:**

- **Least Privilege**: Apply the principle of least privilege by only allowing the necessary traffic.
- **Regular Audits**: Regularly review and audit your Security Groups to ensure they meet your security policies.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name your Security Groups and rules descriptively to help manage and identify them easily.

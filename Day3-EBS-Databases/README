## 1. Day 3 - AWS S3-EBS-Databases
### 1.1. Getting Started with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

#### 1.1.1. Storage Fundamentals

- **Amazon S3** is an object storage service that allows storing and retrieving any amount of data from anywhere on the web.
- **Block Storage** divides files into blocks, each assigned a unique identifier, allowing individual blocks to be modified separately. It's ideal for databases where specific pieces of data need to be accessed or modified without retrieving the entire file.
- **File Storage** uses a hierarchical structure (directories, subdirectories, files) to organize data, requiring knowledge of exact paths to locate and access files.
- **Object Storage** in Amazon S3 is a flat structure where data, called objects, are stored in buckets. It can visually mimic a hierarchy using key name prefixes and delimiters, although the storage remains flat.


#### 1.1.2. Amazon S3 Fundamentals

- **Amazon S3 Overview**: A highly scalable, secure, and performant object storage service designed for simplicity and robustness, providing the same infrastructure used by Amazon globally.

- **Object Storage Structure**: S3 uses a flat storage structure where objects (data) are stored in buckets. Hierarchies can be simulated using prefixes and delimiters to organize data logically, though physically, the structure remains flat.

- **Buckets**: Permanent containers that hold objects. Bucket names are globally unique, can’t be renamed, and must follow specific naming rules (e.g., DNS-compliant, 3-63 characters, lowercase letters, and no IP address format). By default, each AWS account can create up to 100 buckets, expandable to 1,000.

- **Object Metadata**: Objects in S3 include key (unique identifier), version ID, value (data content), metadata (system or user-defined), and access control information. Metadata can only be set at upload and cannot be modified post-upload without creating a new object version.

- **Object Tagging**: Tags are key-value pairs that help categorize and manage storage. Object tags can control access, lifecycle policies, and CloudWatch metrics, supporting up to 10 tags per object.

- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR) & Same-Region Replication (SRR)**: CRR replicates objects between buckets in different AWS regions for data redundancy and compliance. SRR replicates objects within the same region for use cases like log aggregation or maintaining copies for compliance.

- **S3 Static Website Hosting**: S3 can host static websites with content that doesn’t change frequently, unlike dynamic websites. The service offers options to configure domain settings, error handling, and redirects.

- **Bucket Lifecycle Management**: S3 allows for versioning and lifecycle policies to manage objects over time, balancing between storage cost and data retention needs.

- **Access Control**: S3 supports resource-based (e.g., bucket policies, ACLs) and user-based access controls, ensuring fine-grained control over who can access specific objects or buckets.

- **Region Considerations**: When creating a bucket, selecting a region close to your users minimizes latency and meets regulatory requirements. S3’s globally viewable service simplifies management across different regions.

- **Naming Constraints**: Bucket names are unique across S3, DNS-compliant, between 3-63 characters, starting with a lowercase letter or number, and cannot resemble an IP address. Bucket names are vital for correct functionality, especially in static website hosting.


#### 1.1.3. Interfacing with Amazon S3

- **AWS Management Console:** 
  - Provides a simple web interface to interact with Amazon S3.
  - Allows for viewing, uploading, downloading data, and managing permissions without code.

  - Ideal for integrating S3 functionality into applications, providing flexibility and customization.

- **REST API:**
  - A direct HTTP interface to interact with S3, allowing standard HTTP requests to create, fetch, and delete buckets and objects.
  - Offers two addressing models: Path-style URLs (deprecated as of September 2020) and Virtual hosted-style URLs.

- **Path-style URLs:**
  - Format: `https://region-specific-endpoint/bucket/object`.
  - Deprecated for new buckets, but existing ones are still supported.

- **Virtual hosted-style URLs:**
  - Format: `https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/object`.
  - More user-friendly and customizable; allows use of custom domain names.

- **DNS Request Handling:**
  - S3 uses DNS to route requests to appropriate facilities, ensuring high availability.
  - Temporary redirects may occur due to DNS propagation delays, especially right after bucket creation.

- **Temporary DNS Redirects:**
  - Occur when a request is routed to the wrong region; S3 responds with an HTTP 302 redirect to the correct endpoint.
  - Ensures that requests are eventually routed to the correct location.


#### 1.1.4. Amazon S3 Data Management



- **Data Consistency Model**
  - Amazon S3 now offers strong read-after-write consistency for all operations.

- **Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)**: Automates the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs using lifecycle policies, schedules, and resource tags.

- **Lifecycle Policies**: DLM supports snapshot lifecycle policies for automating EBS snapshot management and AMI lifecycle policies for managing EBS-backed AMIs. Policies can target volumes or instances and automate tasks based on defined schedules and retention rules.

- **Policy Schedules**: Policies can have up to four schedules to manage snapshot or AMI creation frequencies, including daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly backups, with custom tags and retention settings.

- **Multi-Volume Snapshots**: EBS Snapshots support crash-consistent backups across multiple EBS volumes attached to an EC2 instance, ensuring data-coordinated snapshots at a specific point in time.

- **Snapshot Events & Monitoring**: EBS Snapshot events (creation, copying, sharing) are tracked using CloudWatch, allowing for better monitoring and management.

- **Snapshot Quotas**: You can create up to 100 lifecycle policies per AWS Region, with each resource (e.g., EBS volume, AMI) supporting up to 45 tags.



#### 1.2.9. Amazon EBS Pricing

- **Pay-As-You-Use**: Amazon EBS charges based on provisioned volume size, IOPS, and throughput. Pricing varies by volume type and Availability Zone.

- **Provisioned Volume Size**: Costs are calculated based on the volume size provisioned. For example, a 100 GB volume provisioned for 30 days would be charged based on the rate per GB-month.

- **Provisioned IOPS**: Charges apply for IOPS provisioned above the baseline. For example, gp3 volumes include 3,000 IOPS for free; additional IOPS are billed separately.

- **Provisioned Throughput**: Costs are calculated for throughput provisioned above the baseline. For gp3 volumes, 125 MB/s is included, with extra throughput billed separately.

- **Cost Calculation by Time Unit**: Rates can be calculated per day, hour, minute, or second using appropriate formulas, adjusting for usage periods shorter than a full month.

- **SSD-backed EBS Volumes**: Includes gp2, gp3, io1, and io2 types. Charges differ by type, with gp2 including I/O in the price, and gp3 offering customizable IOPS and throughput.

- **HDD-backed EBS Volumes**: Includes st1 and sc1 types. Charges are based solely on provisioned storage, with no separate IOPS or throughput charges.

- **Elastic Volumes**: Volume sizes can be increased within the same volume, but decreasing size requires copying data to a new, smaller EBS volume.

- **Region-Specific Pricing**: Prices vary by AWS Region, and all examples are based on the US East (N. Virginia) region as of March 2021.

- **Billing Increments**: Charges for provisioned storage, IOPS, and throughput are billed in per-second increments, with a minimum of 60 seconds.

- **Snapshot Pricing**: Snapshot costs are based on the actual storage space used, not the provisioned size.



#### 1.2.10. Pricing exercise

You need to provide budgeting for a new application. For this application, you have determined that you need one General Purpose SSD gp3 volume and one Throughput Optimized HDD st1 volume. The application is intended for long-term use.

gp3 volume requirements include 3,000 IOPS of sustained performance, 75 GB of volume space, and daily snapshots. Your daily rate of change is 1 GB.

st1 volume requirements include 40 MB/s of sustained throughput, 500 GB of volume space, and hourly snapshots. The calculated volume size to meet the sustained performance requirements is 1 TB. Your hourly rate of change is 1 GB.

Pricing is compared based on a full month of use. You use the default Average duration for each instance as 730 hours per month.

What is the total cost estimate for the new application?

#### 1.2.11. Basic Amazon EBS Architecture




#### 1.2.12. Amazon EBS integrations




##### 1.2.12.1 Data Security


1. **Amazon EBS Integration**:
   - Amazon EBS integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to secure data access.

2. **IAM for Amazon EBS**:
   - IAM manages permissions for users, groups, and roles, controlling access to Amazon EBS and Amazon EC2 resources.
   - By default, IAM identities do not have access to AWS resources. Permissions are granted through IAM policies.

3. **IAM Policies**:
   - Standalone IAM policies, managed by AWS, cater to common use cases, simplifying permissions management.
   - Custom IAM policies can be created to restrict access and management capabilities for EBS volumes.

4. **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**:
   - KMS provides encryption for Amazon EBS, eliminating the need for a self-managed key infrastructure.
   - KMS uses customer-managed keys (CMK) or AWS-managed keys to encrypt volumes and snapshots.

5. **Amazon EBS Encryption**:
   - EBS encryption protects data at rest and in transit between EC2 instances and attached EBS storage.
   - Encryption is supported for both EBS boot and data volumes, with data secured using AES-256 algorithm.

6. **Data Security**:
   - Encrypted EBS volumes ensure that all data (at rest, in transit, snapshots) is protected.
   - The data key used for encryption is secured with a customer-managed key and is never stored in plaintext.

7. **Encryption Scope**:
   - Encrypted volumes automatically secure all associated snapshots and any new volumes created from those snapshots.

8. **Security Architecture**:
   - Encryption operations occur on the servers hosting EC2 instances, maintaining robust security for data interactions.



##### 1.2.12.2 AWS Backup

- **Centralized Data Protection**: AWS Backup allows you to centralize and automate data protection across various AWS services, simplifying backup management and meeting business continuity goals.

- **Integration with AWS Organizations**: You can deploy backup policies across multiple AWS accounts and resources within your organization using AWS Backup in conjunction with AWS Organizations.

- **Backup Storage**: AWS Backup stores backups in an AWS managed Amazon S3 bucket, ensuring secure and scalable backup storage.

- **Policy-Based Backup**: Create and manage backup policies (backup plans) to define and apply backup requirements tailored to business and regulatory needs.

- **Tag-Based Policies**: Apply backup plans to resources using tags, simplifying the implementation of backup strategies across various applications.

- **Automated Backup Scheduling**: Customize backup schedules to meet specific requirements or use predefined schedules. AWS Backup automates the backup process based on these schedules.

- **Retention Management**: Set automated backup retention policies to manage the lifespan of backups and reduce storage costs by retaining backups only as long as necessary.

- **Backup Monitoring**: Utilize the AWS Backup dashboard to monitor and audit backup and restore activities across services, ensuring that resources are protected.

- **Lifecycle Management**: Configure lifecycle policies to transition backups from warm storage to cold storage, balancing cost and compliance requirements.

- **Access Control**: Set resource-based access policies on Backup Vaults to manage and secure access to backups centrally.

- **Cross-Region Backup**: Copy backups to different AWS regions either manually or automatically, enhancing disaster recovery and compliance.

- **Cross-Account Backup**: Securely copy backups across AWS accounts within your organization, providing protection against disruptions in the source account and facilitating recovery.

   - Metrics are available in 1-minute intervals at no charge.

2. **Data Granularity**:
   - The `Period` request parameter determines the granularity of the data returned.
   - It's recommended to set the period equal to or greater than the data collection period (1 minute) for valid data.

3. **Data Access**:
   - Data can be accessed through the CloudWatch API or the Amazon EC2 console.
   - The API provides raw data, while the console displays graphs based on the data.

4. **Monitoring EBS Volumes**:
   - CloudWatch monitors EBS volume activity and stores metrics in the AWS Management Console for EC2.

5. **EBS Metrics**:
   - **VolumeReadBytes**: Bytes read in a specified period.
   - **VolumeWriteBytes**: Bytes written in a specified period.
   - **VolumeReadOps**: Total number of read operations.
   - **VolumeWriteOps**: Total number of write operations.
   - **VolumeTotalReadTime**: Total seconds spent on read operations.
   - **VolumeTotalWriteTime**: Total seconds spent on write operations.
   - **VolumeIdleTime**: Total seconds with no read or write operations.

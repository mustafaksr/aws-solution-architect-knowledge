Certainly! Let's walk through a use case and then write the Terraform code for it.

### Use Case: Optimizing EBS Costs for a Web Application

#### Scenario
You have a web application running on AWS EC2 instances that require EBS volumes for storage. Your application handles variable workloads, and you need a cost-effective and performance-optimized solution. You need to:
1. **Choose the right EBS volume type** based on the application's performance requirements.
2. **Optimize the volume size and IOPS** to avoid over-provisioning.
3. **Monitor and manage snapshots** to control costs and ensure data recovery.
4. **Adjust the volume size dynamically** based on changing requirements.

#### Requirements
- **Volume Type**: General Purpose SSD (gp3) for cost-effectiveness.
- **Volume Size**: Start with 100 GB and adjust based on application needs.
- **Provisioned IOPS**: Include 3,000 IOPS as needed.
- **Snapshot Management**: Regularly take snapshots and manage lifecycle.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Adjust volume size if needed.

### Infrastructure

This Terraform configuration sets up a basic AWS infrastructure with the following components:

1. **VPC and Subnet**: References the default VPC and subnet in the specified AWS region to host other resources.
2. **EC2 Instance and EBS Volume**: Launches a `t2.micro` EC2 instance with a specified AMI, attaches a 100GB EBS volume, and configures a security group with rules for ICMP and SSH access.
3. **IAM Roles and Policies**: Defines IAM roles for EC2 and Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM), attaches necessary policies, and creates a DLM policy for daily EBS volume snapshots. Additionally, it sets up an SNS topic to send email notifications for CloudWatch alarms.

### Instructions

Configure AWS cli:
```bash
#install aws cli 
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user

#To configure first create credentials for test_user(create test_user also) from IAM.
#Then use Access key and Secret access key for configration aws cli.
#configure aws cli.
aws configure

#test configuration
aws ls 
```
Deploy Infrastucture:
```bash
cd Day9-DBMigration-S3-EBS/implementations/ebs-cost-optimization
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png
terraform apply
```

Destroy Infrastructure:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
